## üì∏ Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing interview texts from seven distinct fields‚ÄîDesign, ICT, Management, Project Management (PM), Public Service, Research & Development (RND), and Sales & Marketing. Using text mining techniques, the goal is to extract and identify critical keywords that are central to each field.

#### - Keyword Extraction
Identify critical keywords from interview texts across seven fields‚ÄîDesign, ICT, Management, PM, Public Service, RND, and Sales & Marketing‚Äîusing advanced text mining techniques.

#### - Field-Specific Insights
Analyze domain-specific language patterns to better understand each field‚Äôs priorities, values, and expectations.

- # Insight
Interview questions appear to focus on evaluating <core competencies> related to actual job performance, such as experience, problem-solving, and stress management. Therefore, interviewees should prepare specific examples of their problem-solving experiences and the lessons learned from them. It also seems important for interviewees to effectively express their psychological resilience, including examples of how they handled <stressful situations>. Based on this data, it is expected to be useful for analyzing question trends by job category or generating tailored question examples.

#### Insights  
Depending on the key skills emphasized in each role, candidates should prepare experiences and portfolios that demonstrate technical expertise and professional skills. For instance, candidates for design roles should highlight creativity and trend awareness, while those in ICT roles should focus on programming skills and algorithm understanding.

#### Insights
- Female interview questions often focus on social ethics (e.g., corruption, public office) and social media or personal branding (e.g., Instagram, sales). This suggests women may be more associated with roles emphasizing social responsibility and digital marketing.
- Male interview questions tend to focus on technical, economic, and business-related skills (e.g., strengths, profits, welding). This suggests men are more likely to be in roles that prioritize technical expertise and economic outcomes.

#### Insights
- Experienced candidates should highlight examples of problem-solving and strengths demonstrated in real-world scenarios.
- Inexperienced candidates should showcase adaptability and learning potential through relevant examples.

### ‚òòÔ∏è Topic Modeling
**1Ô∏è‚É£ LDA Model**: Identified latent topics from the dataset to uncover hidden themes.  

### Perplexity Analysis  
**Key Findings:**  
- The lowest perplexity was observed at **k=2**, indicating that the dataset is well-represented with a minimal number of topics.  
- Higher values like **k=3** or **k=4** may offer greater interpretability while maintaining model quality.
